A mango tree is not a plant.

A mango tree is a tree, not just a plant.

it is a large, evergreen, flowering tree that grows to heights of up to 100 feet.
While all trees are plants, the term "tree" specifically denotes a woody plant with a trunk and branches that can reach significant heights, which describes a mango tree.
